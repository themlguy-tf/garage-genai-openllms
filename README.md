What are LLMs?
Large language models (LLMs) are deep learning models trained on massive datasets of text. LLMs can translate language, summarize text, generate creative writing, generate code, power chatbots and virtual assistants, and complement search engines and recommendation systems. Creating an LLM requires massive amounts of data, significant compute resources, and specialized skills. Because LLMs require a big investment to create, they target broad rather than specific use cases. On Vertex AI, you can customize a foundation model for more specific tasks or knowledge domains by using prompt design and model tuning.
The Vertex AI Model Garden enables you to test, customize, and deploy instances of Google’s large language models (LLM) as well as Open LLMs like Meta, Mistral, Stable Diffusion, Claude, etc.  You can leverage the capabilities of Open LLMs in your applications. 


Mistral excels at tasks like advanced reasoning, translation, and code generation because of how it was built.

Objectives:

✅ Introduce Vertex Model Garden

✅ Introduce Vertex AI Pipelines

✅ Deploy Mistral 7b model
