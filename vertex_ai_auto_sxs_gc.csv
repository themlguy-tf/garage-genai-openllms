1,"Figures show that for those aged 65, men can expect to live for another 19 years and women a further 21 years. But there is concern that too many elderly people are living in poor health. And the figures vary across the country, with the North East and North West having lower life expectancies for 65-year-olds than other regions. Life expectancy among older age groups in England rose to its highest level in 2014 - with male life expectancy increasing by 0.3 years at age 65 and 0.2 years at ages 75, 85 and 95 since 2013. Female life expectancy increased by the same amounts at the same ages. This comes after a fall in life expectancy in some older age groups between 2011 and 2012. The only region where male and female life expectancy did not increase in 2014 was in the North East, where male life expectancy was higher in 2013. Among local authorities in England, the majority showed an increase or no change in life expectancy at age 65 - but one quarter showed a decrease. In the past, statistics have tended to focus on life expectancy at birth but now that most deaths in England occur in people over the age of 80, patterns of mortality in older age groups are becoming more important. Prof John Newton, chief knowledge officer at Public Health England, said the report presented a positive national picture that made achieving ""a good quality of life in later years even more important"". ""This report is an opportunity to remind people that, even during mid-life, it is not too late to improve your health,"" he said. ""Most of us could make changes today, like stopping smoking, being more active or eating better, that would allow us to look forward to healthier later years."" He said it was not clear what had caused the variation in trends between local areas. Danny Dorling, professor of human geography at the University of Oxford, said there was an urgent need to find out why improvements had stalled in many parts of England in recent years. ""Beneath the headline figures of this report, there is evidence of worsening health for many older people in some parts of the country,"" he said. In Scotland, life expectancy continued to improve, with 65-year-old men expected to live for a further 17.4 years and women a further 19.7 years, according to the latest statistics. But there are also wide variations across the country.","Life expectancy in England has reached its highest level, with men expected to live to 84 and women to 85. However, there are concerns about the health of elderly people, as many are living with poor health. Life expectancy varies across the country, with the North East and North West having lower life expectancies than other regions. There was also variation among local authorities, with some showing decreases in life expectancy. Public Health England's chief knowledge officer, Prof John Newton, emphasized the importance of maintaining good health in later years and encouraged people to make healthy lifestyle changes. In Scotland, life expectancy has also continued to improve, with men expected to live to 82.4 and women to 84.7 years","Life expectancy among older age groups in England rose to its highest level in 2014, with men aged 65 expected to live another 19 years and women 21 more years on average. However, there are concerns about many elderly living in poor health and regional variations, with lower life expectancies for 65-year-olds in the North East and North West compared to other regions. While life expectancy improved nationally, it did not increase in the North East for men and women in 2014. About a quarter of local authorities in England saw a decrease in life expectancy at age 65. Experts stress the importance of maintaining a good quality of life in later years through lifestyle changes like stopping smoking and being more active."

But Juan Martin Hernandez and Martin Landajo both scored as the Pumas refused to lie down. Full-back Leigh Halfpenny's 78th-minute penalty edged Wales four points clear to settle the encounter. The Toulon full-back scored 14 points with the boot, which ultimately proved the difference between the sides in a match which did not quite live up to expectations. Read: Wales restored pride, says Howley Howley praises 'world class' lock Jones Following their 32-8 defeat by Australia the previous week, Wales were relieved to hang on against a Pumas side that refused to buckle in the face of extreme pressure. After coach Rob Howley had asked for a response from his team, man of the match Alun Wyn Jones and wing Williams - who both missed the Wallabies defeat - made a huge impact on their returns. Williams' determination for his try typified a full-blooded display by the Scarlets back. Argentina failed to rediscover the exciting running which saw them beat Ireland at the same stadium in the 2015 World Cup. And while Howley would be pleased with the improvement in Wales' performance, a lack of composure in attack, particularly when they were on top in the first half, will be a concern. Wales controlled the opening period but, apart from two penalties by Halfpenny, had little to show for their dominance at the break as Argentina repeatedly infringed in their own 22. When referee Angus Gardner finally lost patience and sent prop Ramiro Herrera to the sin-bin with a minute of the first half remaining, Wales were promptly penalised at the next scrum and went in with a three-point lead which barely reflected the run of play. Media playback is not supported on this device After the break, wing Williams produced a tenacious finish to edge Wales eight points clear before Landajo's opportunism from a quick penalty created a try for the superb Hernandez. When Davies dummied over for his eighth international try and Halfpenny converted, it looked as though Wales would pull clear. But the Pumas, with Sanchez a probing threat at fly-half, hit back again when Landajo was given the benefit of the doubt by television official Sean Davey. An exchange of penalties meant Wales led by a point before Halfpenny eased the nerves with his fifth successful kick of the game. Wales: Leigh Halfpenny, George North, Jonathan Davies, Scott Williams, Liam Williams, Dan Biggar, Gareth Davies; Gethin Jenkins (captain), Ken Owens, Tomas Francis, Luke Charteris, Alun Wyn Jones, Sam Warburton, Justin Tipuric, Ross Moriarty.

Argentina's strong defense kept them in the game, but a penalty in the 78th minute by Leigh Halfpenny secured the win for Wales.

3,"But the Premier League club say they want Allardyce to stay, insisting he is ""very much key to our plans"". Sunderland claim speculation about Allardyce has been ""extremely damaging"" and have urged the FA to ""bring about a swift resolution to the matter"". England are searching for a new boss after Roy Hodgson quit on 28 June. He resigned after the national team were knocked out of Euro 2016 at the last-16 stage by Iceland. Photographs that appeared to show Allardyce, 61, at the home of FA vice-chairman David Gill were published in the media in the past 24 hours. Allardyce had been on tour with Sunderland in Austria until he returned home at the start of the week, reportedly on transfer business. Sunderland said they agreed to let Allardyce speak with the FA as a ""potential candidate"" after he requested permission, but are upset discussions did not remain confidential. ""After what was an extremely challenging season, we are keen to see a period of stability, both on and off the field, and we want him to remain as manager of our football club,"" read a club statement issued on Wednesday. Kevin Davies, who played under Allardyce at Bolton, thinks his former boss would be a good choice for England. ""Where we are now as a nation, I think he is probably the right man,"" said Davies, who earned one England cap during his career. ""Motivation-wise, he is fantastic, the best I have ever worked with. He knows how to get the best out of a player. ""He has a lot of other strengths, too. He surrounds himself with the best people in the best roles, which allows him to plan and get the best out of his squad."" Davies also thinks Allardyce will improve morale in the dressing room. ""The atmosphere he will create will be similar to Wales or Iceland... that spirit, that togetherness, along with the ability that we have a lacked,"" said Davies. ""I think he has always thrived on being the underdog and I think England are going to go into a lot of games as underdogs in the future, so it probably will suit the way England are at the moment. "" Allardyce is not the only Premier League manager linked with the England job. Arsenal's Arsene Wenger, Bournemouth's Eddie Howe and Hull City's Steve Bruce have all been touted as possible candidates. United States boss Jurgen Klinsmann and former England manager Glenn Hoddle have also been linked with the job, but Allardyce is the frontrunner. The former West Ham, Newcastle, Bolton and Blackburn boss, who has one year left on his Sunderland contract, won a lot of plaudits for keeping the Black Cats in the Premier League last season. England begin their 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign on 4 September, when they face Slovakia in Trnava. The two sides met at Euro 2016, battling out a goalless draw in Group B. Media playback is not supported on this device The England manager will be chosen by a three-man panel - Gill, FA technical director Dan Ashworth and chief executive Martin Glenn. They want the next boss to be a strong-minded, tactically savvy manager who will build a clear team identity and help shape the team into a cohesive unit. Allardyce was previously interviewed for the role in 2006 after Sven-Goran Eriksson left following that year's World Cup. Eriksson's assistant Steve McClaren got the job instead but he failed to guide England to qualification for the 2008 European Championship. Here's what Allardyce has since said about the England job: 2009 After missing out to McClaren: ""I should have got it and I really don't know why I didn't. It had to be political for me, rather than my credentials. ""Maybe my external look isn't to everybody's liking. It was the right time and the right job for me but not from the FA's point of view. ""It seems foreign coaches are still all the craze for the top jobs and that is a great shame. I also think that Steve not being successful was a massive blow for British or English managers, because it has put us down a peg or two."" 2015 From his autobiography: ""I wanted to do a real knock-your-socks-off interview for the FA, so I put together a PowerPoint which looked at every single detail. ""Nobody but nobody was going to beat it. But then Brian Barwick, the chief executive, told me there were no PowerPoint facilities at the interview venue, so I had to print off hard copies for the panel. So much for the progressive FA. ""I should have got it and, as I'm a better manager now than I was then, I believe I should be in the running whenever it comes round again. That's not vanity or being full of my own importance. My track record entitles me to be considered."" May 2016 Prior to Euro 2016: ""That's gone. For me to be interested in the England job, Roy would probably have to leave at the end of the Euros. ""And would England be interested in me? They say they are looking for an English manager, but will they do it? You've got this, 'what's sexier?' element now, rather than how good you are at doing the job.","Sunderland wants Sam Allardyce to remain as their manager, stating he is key to their plans, and claiming speculation about him leaving has been damaging. However, they agreed to let Allardyce speak with the FA about the vacant England job after he requested permission. Allardyce is the frontrunner for the England role, though other candidates like Wenger, Howe, Bruce, Klinsmann and Hoddle have been linked. Allardyce previously missed out on the England job in 2006 to Steve McClaren, feeling his credentials were overlooked for political reasons. He believes his track record now entitles him to be considered, having prepared extensively with a PowerPoint presentation in 2006 that the FA could not accommodate. The FA wants the next England manager to be tactically astute and able to build a team identity.","The Sunderland football club has released a statement urging the FA to resolve the matter of their manager, Sam Allardyce, as soon as possible. Allardyce is reportedly the frontrunner for the England manager job after Roy Hodgson quit following their Euro 2016 exit. Sunderland are keen to see a period of stability and want Allardyce to remain as their manager."
4,"If he does become the next Premier League manager to lose his job, it would not just be unfair, it would be absolutely ridiculous. I cleaned Tim's boots when I was an apprentice at Norwich in the late 1980s, and he was the captain at Blackburn Rovers when we won the Premier League together in 1995. Of course I am not just backing him to succeed at Villa because I used to play with him - the reason is that, since the earliest days of my career, I have always seen him as manager material. When I was a teenager I looked up to him because I liked the way he went about things and how he dealt with me and other people. Even though he was a young man then too, the other players all thought the same. Character is a bit of a buzzword these days, but as a player I looked around for team-mates who had the ability to handle pressure and Tim was always one of them. At 46, he is a relatively young manager now, certainly in terms of experience, but you have to remember he was quite a young captain at Blackburn too - he was 26 when we were champions. We had some pretty big-hitters in terms of personalities in that dressing room, the likes of Alan Shearer, David Batty, Tim Flowers and Colin Hendry. They were never afraid to have their say but, if you speak to them, they will all tell you they admired Tim not just for what he brought to the team as a player but also his contribution to the club's success as captain. For Tim to be skipper ahead of, say, Shearer shows you what the Blackburn boss Kenny Dalglish thought of him too. He always had the leadership qualities you need as a manager and, on top of that, I always thought he was extremely knowledgeable about the game. He comes across as confident or even cocky in some respects, but in the dressing room it doesn't matter whether you are an introvert or an extrovert as long as what you are saying makes sense. Tim always did. So it does not surprise me that, as a manager, he has got the best out of players who had been under-performing - like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season - because he has always had the ability to get people playing for him. At times he might say things that players don't like - because he tells the truth. That ruffles a few feathers but I don't mind it, in fact he should be commended for it. These days I hear a lot of people in football say things with no substance behind them, but Tim certainly is not like that - he can always back his opinions up. Tim earned his right to have a proper crack at being Villa boss with the incredible job he did to keep them up after taking charge in February, when they were in desperate trouble with a dreadful scoring record. Villa have been fighting relegation for a few years now under several different managers so this season was never going to be any different. But, just eight games into the new campaign and at the first sign of adversity, Sherwood already appears to be under massive pressure. You have to take into consideration that he lost his two best players over the summer in striker Benteke and midfielder Delph, who were both inspirational for him last season, and realise he is trying to build a new team with all the signings that Villa have made. Villa's net spend over the summer was under £10m - and a lot of that went on young players with little or no Premier League experience. They have plenty of potential, and also plenty of sell-on value which seems to be a big part of the club's thinking, but it is a gamble whether they work out for Villa now and that is Sherwood's problem. I don't know who had the final say on each deal but from what I understand, Villa's head of recruitment Paddy Reilly and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt play a big part in the process. You cannot blame Tim for the squad not being strong enough if it is not just down to him, but he is the one who is being criticised because Villa have not won since the opening day. I get why the club's owner Randy Lerner might be getting twitchy because of the amount of money at stake if they go down, but the logical thing to do is to give Sherwood more time because he is an intelligent man who has already shown he can improve players - which is exactly what Villa need now. Sherwood has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence while he beds those new signings in and finds a system that works with the players he has got. The choices he has to make with his current forwards is an example of how difficult that is. Like Benteke, Rudy Gestede has tremendous physical attributes and is as good as there is in the air in the Premier League. In an effort to make the most of that, Sherwood has tried to get his full-backs forward to get crosses into the box - Jordan Amavi and Alan Hutton or Leandro Bacuna have all done that far more than any of Villa's midfielders. But what Gestede doesn't have is the ability to link up play, or the pace to get behind defences. In that way, Benteke was much more of an all-round striker. Sherwood can leave out Gestede and play Gabriel Agbonlahor or Jordan Ayew if he wants pace, but then he does not have that same physical presence up front, or any aerial threat. Whoever he picks, he is missing something that Benteke provided on his own. Because he is trying to find that balance between attack and defence, he cannot always play two up front to solve that problem, especially because he is also trying to fit Jack Grealish into his team as an attacking midfielder. Grealish is a young player who has a lot of talent but picking him creates a different issue because winning games is not just down to what happens when you have got the ball. However good Grealish is going forward, he does not always put in a shift going back the other way. When you lose possession, you need to be compact and tight defensively and Villa have lacked that in the games I have seen, notably in their defeat by Leicester when they were hit on the counter-attack time and time again. You really need defensive responsibility when you are in Villa's position near the bottom of the table. That might be one of the reasons why Sherwood has apparently used this international break to try to get Grealish fitter. After trying so many formations and line-ups, maybe we will see Sherwood sticking with just one in the next five or six games. A settled system and some continuity is what Villa need at the moment. Tim knows that and, if he is given the chance, I am confident he will get it right. Chris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.","Tim Sherwood should not be sacked as Aston Villa manager. He took over when the team was struggling and has shown he can improve players. He is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence and is still trying to find a system that works with the players he has got. He has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defense while he beds those new signings in. Sherwood has earned his right to have a proper crack at being Villa boss with the incredible job he did to keep them up after taking charge in February when they were in desperate trouble with a dreadful scoring record.","The author strongly supports Tim Sherwood succeeding as Aston Villa manager, arguing he has the character, leadership qualities, and tactical knowledge required. The author believes Sherwood has already improved players at Villa like Adebayor previously at Spurs, and should be given more time despite Villa's poor start as he tries to rebuild the squad following the summer departures of Benteke and Delph. Sherwood is still searching for the right balance and system to compensate for losing Benteke's all-round abilities as a striker. The author is confident that if given a chance, Sherwood will get Villa playing well."

6,"He is approaching the end of his 10th year in charge and thinks it is the right time to seek a fresh challenge.

9,"The 130m-tall (420ft) Bulford Kiwi, on Bulford Hill near Stonehenge, was carved by New Zealand troops who were stationed there. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has made it a scheduled monument on the advice of Historic England. Kiwi soldiers played a significant role in the Battle of Messines, fought in June 1917 in Belgium. Another monument at Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, marking the same battle, has also been granted protection. The Terrain Model of Messines - a scale model of the battlefield - was made by German prisoners of war using soil, concrete, bricks and pebbles. The model was a popular tourist attraction at the end of the war, but it became neglected and was lost until it was recently excavated. It has now been covered over again to protect it from damage and erosion. Roger Bowdler from Historic England said: ""These two monuments pay tribute to the bravery of New Zealand's fighting forces in the First World War and we are delighted that they are now being protected for the future. ""The Bulford Kiwi was cut into the chalk at the end of the war by Kiwi soldiers themselves, to mark the presence of their forces in England, and their achievements at the front. ""The taking of the Messines ridge was one of the war's most stirring attacks, and this model lay-out remains as testimony to the planning which made possible the victory. ""Like so much of our historic environment, these lasting reminders enable us to connect with lives and events from the past that made us who we are as a nation.
